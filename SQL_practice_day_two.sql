+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
 

Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by employee_id.

SELECT employee_id,
CASE 
WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%'
    THEN salary 
    ELSE 0
END
AS bonus
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;

+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key.
This table contains the date and the name of the product sold and the IDs of the lead and partner it was sold to.
The name consists of only lowercase English letters.
 

Write an SQL query that will, for each date_id and make_name, return the number of distinct lead_id's and distinct partner_id's.

Return the result table in any order.

SELECT date_id, make_name, 
COUNT(DISTINCT lead_id) AS unique_leads, 
COUNT(DISTINCT partner_id) AS unique_partners
FROM DailySales
GROUP BY date_id, make_name;

| id          | int      |
| name        | varchar  |
| sex         | ENUM     |
| salary      | int      |
+-------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
The sex column is ENUM value of type ('m', 'f').
The table contains information about an employee.
 

Write an SQL query to swap all 'f' and 'm' values (i.e., change all 'f' values to 'm' and vice versa) with a single update statement and no intermediate temporary tables.

Note that you must write a single update statement, do not write any select statement for this problem.

UPDATE Salary
SET
    sex = CASE sex
        WHEN 'm' THEN 'f'
        WHEN 'f' THEN 'm'
    END;

Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| email       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains an email. The emails will not contain uppercase letters.
 

Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

DELETE p1
FROM Person AS p1, Person as p2
WHERE p1.email = p2.email AND p1.id > p2.id
